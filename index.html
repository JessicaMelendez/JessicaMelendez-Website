        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, my name is Jessica Jasmin Melendez Aceves and I will be giving a brief description about myself.
 <br><br>

        For starters, I am currently a first year student attending the University of California Riverside. I am majoring in Art Studio. I am majoring in art studio not only for the soul purpose because I love doing art but because it will be teaching me a variety of techniques within the art field. Learning new techniques will help me learn what I prefer to work with the most but it will overall help me know that I can utilize different techniques. So far I have taken a sculpting and painting class and nonetheless it has been a great experience. Besides learning art at school I have been practicing art since a very young age. I do a mixture of traditional and digital art. The materials I mainly utilize are graphite, and markers but I also have experience with charcoal, watercolor, acrylic paint, oil paint, and pastels. I always have liked to create art but I did not start to really acknowledge what art could do until I entered High School. There I took art classes throughout my four years in High School. Thanks to my art teacher there, she helped me know what I liked to focus on with my art and how I can improve my creativity. She helped me learn the ways art can help people and the careers one can take. With what my High School teacher taught me I decided I would follow my dream to learn more about art and to hopefully one day work to create designs and characters for companies like Disney or DreamWorks. I want to create these illustrations to make people happy and have characters they can relate to like we have had with whoever comes to mind with me saying what I said. If this route does not work out I plan to study Art Education to become an art teacher and be able to teach kids what art can do not only for themselves but for other people as well. I know this career is not easy and that it is very competitive but isn’t every other career the same. Regardless of what happens I will do my best to create art for myself and for others as well to make them happy. Create merchandise of my art; stickers, planners, charms, notebooks, and much more.<br><br>

        There is more to why I want to pursue the art field and how my journey began to even start pursuing this path but for now, I will be taking it a day at a time and see where this journey of mine takes me. And hopefully I will end up doing what I always wanted to do but if not there are ways other careers I can educate myself with. Regardless of what may happen there will always be something new to learn and acquire new techniques from. Therefore, one should never give up even if our path may not look like how we imagined it to be.
